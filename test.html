			How to plan your site's design
		Last Updated: June 06, 2014

		This chapter of the Design Manager User Guide will not focus directly on using Design Manager, but instead discuss some guiding principles to consider when designing, updating, and redesigning your site. If you are looking for more tutorials specifically on using Design Manager, you may want to skip to the next section.

		When you are involved with designing a site, there are several considerations to take into account. In this section, you will not only examine some of these considerations, but also gain some insight into the key steps of the design process.

		Building a site for your end users
		Whether you are building your first website or launching its hundredth iteration, you always want to keep in mind the experience of your end users. The following are some questions to ask yourself throughout the design process to ensure your site is user friendly:

		What are the target personas of the leads that my site will generate?
		Does your site have a clear information architecture with easy to navigate menus, CTAs, and links?
		Does your site express a clear value proposition and concisely explain your products/services?
		Does your website explain your company's mission?
		Do you have any historical page view data from HubSpot and Google Analytics that can help you understand visitors current behavior on your site?
		If you are a marketer or content creator at your company, you will want to ensure that your designers have the answers to these questions, and if you are a designer you will want to make sure you know the answers to these questions, before embarking on the design or redesign process

		Building a site for your internal users
		One common mistake that designers make is focusing purely on the experience of a website's visitors, without taking into account the experience of the people who have to manage the content of the site. A beautiful and end-user friendly site is actually less important from an inbound marketing standpoint than a site that empowers its marketers to crank out quality content. Since enticing content proves key for generating traffic, increasing your site's SEO, converting leads, and closing customers, you don't want a website that can only be updated by someone fluent in HTML and CSS.  

		Here are some questions for designers to ask their marketers and for marketers to answer for their designers:

		How much time do your marketers have to spend on creating content, every week?
		What are the most common types of content that your company will be producing?
		Are there any particular page and email template variations that your team requires?
		How technical is your marketing team?
		Will your marketing team need to be making frequent design decisions, while creating content?
		If designers can optimize their output for marketers, it will not only increase a site's inbound marketing performance, but also reduce the amount of residual work that the designer must do for ongoing updates. Later in this guide, you will learn how using HubSpot's layout builder can help you optimize your site for a marketing team.

		Planning steps of the design process
		Once your designers and your marketers are on the same page, you should begin your design process. Below are some steps that may be helpful. Once again these steps are not specific to HubSpot's COS, but rather best practices for planning your site's design.  

		1. Gather your branding content
		The basic brand assets you should gather include: company name, domain name, logo, brand color scheme, & typography.  Using consistently branded assets can help your end users better understand your site, as well as increase you public brand recognition.

		 1. Gather your branding content
		Company Name
		This may seem obvious, but using a consistent company name across your website is integral to your end user's comprehension of your business. If you are in the process of rebranding, you will want to ensure that all instances of the old name have been replaced in your content, so you don't confuse your visitors. You can of course change your company name later on, but it is a really good idea to have a firm idea of what it will be now and where you will use it across your website.

		 Company Name
		Domain Name
		This may also seem obvious, but you'll want to have decided on your domain name. In fact, you'll need to have it registered with a registrar/name server host that will allow you to edit the DNS records for that domain. Using a consistent domain name is important to ensure that users can find you content. Too many unrelated domain names can create confusion for your users and reduce your primary domains SEO value.

		You can also set up various subdomains if you are using various platforms.  For example, store.yourwebsite.com may bring users to your e-commerce site, while blog.yourwebsite.com might bring users to your HubSpot blog.  

		 Domain Name
		Logo
		Your logo serves as the visual representation of your company. Most businesses have a simple graphic that is recognizable and distinctive to that company and brand. It's okay if you're just starting out and don't have a formal "final" logo figured out yet. But you'll want to have at least a temporary logo on hand when you create your website, just to get off on the right foot.
